  Started planning my first tutorial: a changing progress bar (akin to a health bar but not) that both rose and fell. Found a tutorial on making general progress bars using unity.

   Using multiple tutorials as reference, I tried my first attempt at making a progress bar using code from my IPP 2d game project as a guide. I had some issues at the moment
   as the mask code doesn't seem to want to work when I test it despite the code not having errors and no issues coming up in the console. Currently Troubleshooting to see what      the issue could be.

    After doublechecking my code, I realised I didn't use ``[ExecuteInEditMode]`` so when I went to test it, it wouldn't work. Once I edited the Progress Bar script, it worked         perfectly. Despite this, there are still issues regarding the stretching of the sprite that causes distortion. From here I will ask someone to test out my tutorial to see if
    they have this issue.
